  <h3>Concerns it must have when building websites</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing">Cross browser testing</a></li>
    <li>Always have 3 separede file for html, css and js</li>
    <li>Insert jQuery library, Popper JS, Latest compiled JavaScript script tags</li>
    <li>* {box-sizing: border-box;} at the very benning of CSS</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>JavaScript concerns</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>defer and async(script [async or defer] src="js/script.js")(/script)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>defer</strong> attribute, which tells the browser to
          continue downloading the HTML content once the script tag element
          has been reached. Scripts loaded using the defer attribute (see below)
          will run in the order they appear in the page and execute them as soon
          as the script and content are downloaded</li>
      <li>The <strong>async</strong> attribute, will download the script without
          blocking rendering the page and will execute it as soon as the script
          finishes downloading. You get no guarantee that scripts will run in
          any specific order, only that they will not stop the rest of the page
          from displaying. It is best to use async when the scripts in the page
          run independently from each other and depend on no other script on the
          page. You can't rely on the order the scripts will load in. jquery.js
          may load before or after script2.js and script3.js and if this is the
          case, any functions in those scripts depending on jquery will produce
          an error because jquery will not be defined at the time the script runs.
          async should be used when you have a bunch of background scripts to
          load in, and you just want to get them in place asap</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
