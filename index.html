      <h1 class='greeting'>Hi, I am Narciso.</h1>
      <p class='fl-c'>I have a passion for computers and always loved music.</p>
      <p>Everyone has a story to tell, here is mine, but for now, I'll tell you this:</p>
      <p class='phrase'>Work unleash your true purpose.</p>
      <p>I consider myself a citizen of the world and I have an extreme desire to know a little of everything to be able to make profound decisions that seek the good for the whole system in which we live.</p>
      <p>I have spent my entire life wandering the seas of the heart and mind, the conscious and subconscious and I must say: there are so many vastly important things that we have dropped by, replacing them with so many incredibly shallow ones that makes me extremely upset.</p>
      <p>That is why I love <strong>depth</strong>.</p>
      <p>It is inevitable not to balance between pessimistic and optimistic tendencies, however it is the hard and passionate work that turns dreams into reality, whether in a good or bad mood, it is necessary to move forward with vigor and personality.</p>
      <p>Leaning on the shoulders of giants, I use to reflect my own theories agaist the old ones and every day I have try to be a better person than I was yesterday.</p>
      <p>In my website you will find some extensions of my thoughts translated in beats and programs.</p>
      <p>I would like that you feel free to express any of your thoughts about anything.</p>
      <p>Bye for now and do not forget to go deep into your thoughts, it will allow you to see a view much more powerfull about everthing, and what whould it be difficult to you, no longer will.</p>
